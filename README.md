# gulf-of-maine-projections

A pipeline/workflow for using the Gulf of Maine year-2055 and year-2075 climate projections (Brickman et al. 2016) in species distribution models (cf Ross et al. 2021).

Notes
 - Input data is > 2GB, has to be stored elsewhere (ecocast)
 - Files are currently in matlab format. Convert to netcdf? Or just read in with a package?
